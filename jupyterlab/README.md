# Jupyterlab
JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter. It
offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook
(notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a
flexible and powerful user inteface that can be extended through third party
extensions.
